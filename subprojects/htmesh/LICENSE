It is my understanding that the vast majority of the code in this
directory (kstars/kstars/htmesh) was released by a group of programmers
at Johns Hopkins University under the modified-BSD license which is
code compatible with the GPL which is used for the rest of KStars.

The minor patches I contributed to make the code work on my system
are, of course, also released under the modified-BSD license.  In
addition the six files I wrote to provide an interface to the library
are being released under a dual licenses: modified-BSD, and GPLv2
or later.
