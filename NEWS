 * last release of the old Siril, in 2006.

v0.6
 * a intermediate release before a first beta release
	a lot of changes both in the GUI and the inner structure.
	48 bits RGB fits processing, bmp conversion

a sample session is given here :
	given a directory with a 24 bit bmp series 1.bmp... n.bmp,
	a sample session producing a registered 48bit fit stack
	of those is the following :
		change dir (go to the desired directory)
		file conversion: (defaults are ok for this example)
			->go
		sequence processing (siril detetcs and builds the image sequence)
		select a region in one of the R,G,B layers
			(registration will allways be computed on G layer)
		click register
		click stack
	you are done.
