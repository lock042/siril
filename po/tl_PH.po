"Seven rejection algorithms are available:\n"
"\n"
"<b>Percentile Clipping</b> is a one-step rejection algorithm ideal for small "

"\n"
"<b>Sigma Clipping</b> is an iterative algorithm which will reject pixels "
"whose distance from median will be farthest than two given values in sigma "
"units.\n"
"\n"
"<b>MAD Clipping</b> is an iterative algorithm working as Sigma Clipping "
"except that the estimator used is the Median Absolute Deviation (MAD). This "
"is generally used for noisy infrared image processing.\n"
"\n"
"<b>Median Sigma Clipping</b> is the same algorithm except than the rejected "
"pixels are replaced by the median value.\n"
"\n"
"<b>Winsorized Sigma Clipping</b> is very similar to Sigma Clipping method "
"but it uses an algorithm based on Huber's work [1] [2].\n"
"\n"
"<b>Linear Fit Clipping</b> is an algorithm developed by Juan Conejero, main "
"developer of PixInsight [2]. It fits the best straight line (y=ax+b) of the "
"pixel stack and rejects outliers. This algorithm performs very well with "
"large stack and images containing sky gradients with differing spatial "
"distributions and orientations.\n"
"\n"
"The <b>Generalized Extreme Studentized Deviate Test</b> algorithm [3] is a "
"generalization of Grubbs Test that is used to detect one or more outliers in "
"a univariate data set that follows an approximately normal distribution. "
"This algorithm shows excellent performances with large dataset of more 50 "
