# `bash_d`

Conceived as part of my (unpublished) dotfiles on macOS, this collection of functions outgrew its originally limited scope and I began developing this into the spiritual successor of [bashlib](https://github.com/dehesselle/bashlib).

This is far from finished and comes with no support and without documentation at this point, but I need to put this online now so I can start using this in other projects.
