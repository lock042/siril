.SH NAME
siril - image processing tool for astronomy and other applications

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B siril
[\fIoptions\fR] [\fIfile\fR]
.br
.B siril-cli
[\fIoptions\fR] [\fIfile\fR]


.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBSiril\fP is a powerful image processing tool designed for improving the signal-to-noise ratio of astronomical images. It offers a wide range of tools for aligning, stacking, and enhancing images from various file formats, including image sequences. It features a high-precision 32-bit floating-point engine and supports parallel processing to run quickly.
.br
The application is divided into 2 binaries. The first one, siril, launches the program in graphic mode. The second one, siril-cli, is a command line interface allowing to execute the following options.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B -v, --version
Prints the program name and version, then exits.

.TP
.B -i \fIconf_file\fR
Starts \fBSiril\fP with the specified configuration file.

.TP
.B -f, --format
Prints all supported input image formats, depending on the libraries detected at compile-time.

.TP
.B -c, --copyright
Prints copyright information, then exits.

.TP
.B -h, --help
Displays a brief usage summary.

.TP
.B -p
Starts \fBSiril\fP without the graphical user interface and uses named pipes to accept commands and print logs and status information. On POSIX systems, the named pipes are created in /tmp/siril_commands.in and /tmp/siril_commands.out.

.TP
.B -r \fIinput_pipe_path\fR, --inpipe=\fIinput_pipe_path\fR
Provides an alternative path for the input pipe that receives the commands if \fB-p\fR is passed. The pipe can be created by an external program with the mkfifo(1) command.

.TP
.B -w \fIoutput_pipe_path\fR, --outpipe=\fIoutput_pipe_path\fR
Provides an alternative path for the output pipe that prints logs and status updates if \fB-p\fR is passed. The pipe can be created by an external program with the mkfifo(1) command.

.TP
.B -d \fIworking_directory\fR, --directory=\fIworking_directory\fR
Sets the specified path as the current working directory.

.TP
.B -s \fIscript_file\fR, --script=\fIscript_file\fR
Starts \fBSiril\fP without the graphical user interface and runs the specified script instead. Scripts are text files that contain a list of commands to be executed sequentially. In these files, lines starting with a # are considered as comments. If this option is not passed, pipe operation is assumed as if \fB-p\fR had been passed.

.TP
.B -s -
Redirects inputs written after \fB-\fP to \fBstdin\fP.

.TP
.B \fIfile\fR
Opens the specified image or sequence file immediately after startup.


.SH FILES
.TP
@MAN_CONFIG_PATH@
User preferences that can be overridden by the \fB-i\fR option.

.TP
@MAN_CSS_PATH@
The style sheet used to change the look of the graphical user interface. This is useful for customization or if a GTK theme is incompatible with some colored elements of \fBSiril\fP.
