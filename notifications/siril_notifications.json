    "message": "Although the Gaia archive is now reporting as available, there are ongoing problems with using it for SPCC. The Siril team are not aware of the cause of this as the URL format Siril submits has not changed, and the Gaia archive helpdesk report nothing has changed at their end either. We are working to understand this and implement a fix or alternative, but unless the Gaia archive behaviour reverts to how it was previously it is best to assume that the remote catalogue will not be usable for SPCC for the foreseeable future, certainly not until 1.4.1 (no forecast yet). You should therefore download and use the local SPCC catalogue for now.",
