/**
 * @brief Wrapper around g_spawn_sync
 *
 * This method permits Siril to call external executables that
 * reside on the host. To harmonize behavior among non-flatpak
 * and flatpak platforms, this method requires the caller to
 * set the `G_SPAWN_SEARCH_PATH` flag. If a path search is not
 * desired, the caller should provide an absolute executable path.
 *
 * - On non-flatpak platforms, this function is aliased to
 *   `g_spawn_sync()` and behaves identically—except that
 *   `G_SPAWN_SEARCH_PATH` must be set.
 *
 * - On flatpak, this function requests that the flatpak runtime
 *   start the specified executable (by `argv`) outside of the
 *   flatpak sandbox, directly on the host.
 *
 * The arguments and behavior are otherwise as per
 * \ref g_spawn_sync()
