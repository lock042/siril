This is used by the SOS booster to determine the amount of noisy image added in to the intermediate result between each iteration. If -sos=n is not specified then the parameter is ignored.\n\nThe default is not to apply DA3D or SOS, as the improvement in denoising is usually relatively small and these techniques requires additional processing time.\n\nIn very rare cases, blocky coloured artefacts may be found in the output when denoising colour images.

If no argument other than the sequence name is provided, sum stacking is assumed.\n\nStacking with rejection:\nTypes rej or mean require the use of additional arguments for rejection type and values. The rejection type is one of { n[one] | p[ercentile] | s[igma] | m[edian] | w[insorized] | l[inear] | g[eneralized] | [m]a[d] } for Percentile, Sigma, Median, Winsorized, Linear-Fit, Generalized Extreme Studentized Deviate Test or k-MAD clipping. If omitted, the default (Winsorized) is used.\nThe <b>sigma low</b> and <b>sigma high</b> parameters of rejection are mandatory unless <b>none</b> is selected.\nOptionally, rejection maps can be created, showing where pixels were rejected in one (<b>-rejmap</b>) or two (<b>-rejmaps</b>, for low and high rejections) newly created images.\n\nNormalization of input images:\nFor med|median and rej|mean stacking types, different types of normalization are allowed: <b>-norm=add</b> for additive, <b>-norm=mul</b> for multiplicative. Options <b>-norm=addscale</b> and <b>-norm=mulscale</b> apply same normalization but with scale operations. <b>-nonorm</b> is the option to disable normalization. Otherwise addtive with scale method is applied by default.\n<b>-fastnorm</b> option specifies to use faster estimators for location and scale than the default IKSS.\n<b>-rgb_equal</b> will use normalization to equalize color image backgrounds, useful if pcc and unlinked autostretch will not be used.\n\nOther options for rejection stacking:\n<b>-weight_from_noise</b> is an option to add larger weights to frames with lower background noise.\n<b>-weight_from_nbstack</b> weights input images based on how many images were used to create them, useful for live stacking.\n<b>-weight_from_nbstars</b> or <b>-weight_from_wfwhm</b> weight input images based on number of stars or wFWHM computed during registration step.\n\nOutputs:\nResult image name can be set with the <b>-out=</b> option. Otherwise, it will be named as <b>sequencename</b>_stacked.fit.\n<b>-output_norm</b> applies a normalization to rescale result in the [0, 1] range (median and mean stacking only).\n\nFiltering out images:\nImages to be stacked can be selected based on some filters, like manual selection or best FWHM, with some of the <b>-filter-*</b> options.\nSee the command reference for the complete documentation on this command")

The directory must contain the Command Line Tool version (not GUI version which exists for Windows users).\n\nThe starless image is loaded on completion, and a star mask image is created in the working directory unless the optional parameter <b>-nostarmask</b> is provided.\n\nOptionally, parameters may be passed to the command:\n- The option <b>-stretch</b> is for use with linear images and will apply a pre-stretch before running StarNet and the inverse stretch to the generated starless and starmask images.\n- To improve star removal on images with very tight stars, the parameter <b>-upscale</b> may be provided. This will upsample the image by a factor of 2 prior to StarNet processing and rescale it to the original size afterwards, at the expense of more processing time.\n- The optional parameter <b>-stride=value</b> may be provided, however the author of StarNet <i>strongly</i> recommends that the default stride of 256 be used.\n\nMore tips and tricks are available <a href=\"https://www.starnetastro.com/tips-tricks/\">there</a>")

If you have not run star detection, it will be run automatically with default settings.\n\nFor best results synthstar should be run before stretching. \n\nThe output of synthstar is a fully corrected synthetic star mask comprising perfectly round star PSFs (Moffat or Gaussian profiles depending on star saturation) computed to match the intensity, FWHM, hue and saturation measured for each star detected in the input image. This can then be recombined with the starless image to produce an image with perfect stars.\n\nNo parameters are required for this command")
