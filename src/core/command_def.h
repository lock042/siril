This is used by the SOS booster to determine the amount of noisy image added in to the intermediate result between each iteration. If -sos=n is not specified then the parameter is ignored.\n\nThe default is not to apply DA3D or SOS, as the improvement in denoising is usually relatively small and these techniques requires additional processing time.\n\nIn very rare cases, blocky coloured artefacts may be found in the output when denoising colour images.
