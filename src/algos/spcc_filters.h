/*
 * DATA QUALITY
 *
 * Sensor QE data and filter transmittance data is obtained from various sources. These are annotated with a rough
 * guide to quality in the header file below.
 *
 * A: tabulated data from the manufacturer with data points closely spaced in wavelength and covering the whole
 * visible spectrum 380nm to 700nm.
 *
 * B: published generic data for "reference filter types", this is common across manufacturers OR high quality data
 * but with data points more widely spaced in wavelength.
 *
 * C: data scanned from computer-generated charts. This data is cruder (but still sufficient to give good results for
 * the purpose of SPCC).
 *
 * D: data scanned from paper charts. This data is low quality data and will be avoided where possible.
