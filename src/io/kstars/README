These files come from https://invent.kde.org/education/kstars/-/tree/master/kstars/data/tools
or are inspired from the nomadbinfiletester.c file.

With ../catalogues.c, these files serve as an interface to KStars binary
catalogue format. It is a C implementation derived from the KStars tool
nomadbinfiletester.c, simpler than the actual C++ implementation of KStars for
catalogue access.

The structure of the file is documented at
https://api.kde.org/kstars/html/Stars.html#BinaryFormat

See also ../../../subprojects/htmesh/README for complete information.


See also the LICENSES file in the same directory, for data origin.
